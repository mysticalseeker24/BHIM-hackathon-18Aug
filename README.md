### **Data Security:**
- **AES Encryption**: For encrypting sensitive user data (e.g., Aadhaar, bank details) both in transit and at rest.
- **SSL/TLS**: For secure communication between frontend, backend, and external services.

### **Cloud Infrastructure:**
- **AWS**: Hosting and managing the application, with auto-scaling to ensure smooth performance during high traffic.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration for scalable deployments.

## **Code Architecture**

### **1. Backend Structure**
The backend follows a **microservices architecture**, with the following core services:

- **User Service**: Handles user registration, Aadhaar/Bank KYC verification, and authentication.
- **Payment Service**: Manages all payment-related activities, including peer-to-peer transfers, group savings, and fund disbursements.
- **Investment Service**: Tracks micro-investment opportunities and handles the management of pooled funds.
- **Support Service**: Manages support tickets, live chat, and other help-related interactions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends personalized alerts and notifications based on location and user preferences.

Each microservice is independently deployed using **Docker containers** and orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, allowing for horizontal scaling of individual services based on demand.

### **2. Database Schema**
- **User Table**: Stores user information, including Aadhaar/Bank KYC details, verification status, and role (e.g., individual, entrepreneur).
- **Transaction Table**: Records all peer-to-peer and group transactions, including timestamps, amounts, and participants.
- **Group Savings Table**: Tracks savings groups, individual contributions, and collective investment funds.
- **Support Table**: Maintains records of support tickets, live chat logs, and resolutions.

### **3. API Structure**
The APIs are structured around **RESTful principles**, with endpoints categorized by feature:

- `/auth/register` - Register a new user with Aadhaar/Bank KYC verification.
- `/auth/login` - User authentication and JWT token generation.
- `/payment/send` - Send a peer-to-peer payment.
- `/group/create` - Create a new savings group.
- `/group/contribute` - Contribute to a group savings pool.
- `/emergency/request` - Request an emergency fund.
- `/support/ticket` - Submit a support request.

Each endpoint is secured via **JWT-based authentication**, ensuring that only authorized users can access or perform specific actions.

## **Deployment**
1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/women-centric-peer-to-peer-payments.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   cd women-centric-peer-to-peer-payments
   npm install

3. **Run the Backend**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

5. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Build and push Docker images for each microservice.
   - Deploy the images to an AWS ECS or Kubernetes cluster.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **AI-based Financial Insights**: Use machine learning to provide women with financial insights, advice, and trends based on their spending and saving patterns.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand accessibility by supporting multiple regional languages.
- **Voice-Activated Payments**: For users with limited literacy or technical skills, integrating voice commands for making transactions.
